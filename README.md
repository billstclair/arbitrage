[Arbitrage](https://arbitrage.wtf) is an Automated Crypto Arbitrage trading system.

I have abandoned work in this. 
It's too hard to find pricing info.

For development:

$ cd .../arbitrage<br/>
$ elm reactor

Then aim your browser at http://localhost:8000/site/index.html

To build the Elm code into `site/elm.js`:

$ cd .../arbitrage<br/>
$ ./bin/build
